    Mixin class to create a node as an computational graph representing
    a variable or expression. (As opposed to an operation.)

    The initialization signature matches that of a graph node, allowing
    internal graph functions such as `copy()` and `clone()` to work.
    When mixing into another class, make sure this initialization signature
    remains valid (reminder: multiple inheritance precedence goes left to right).

    In addition to the default initialization, it is also possible to
    pass an already instantiated tensor (which we refer to as `expr`).
    This can be useful to wrap a plain tensor with a custom symbolic
    subclass. In this case, one of two things happen
    - If `expr` is already of the type that would be returned, return
      it unchanged.
    - Otherwise, add an identity operation whose output is of the
      new type.
